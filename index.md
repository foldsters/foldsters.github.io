# Welcome to Foldster's Projects!

### Who I am

My name is Matthew Giallourakis, but I go by Foldster online. I have a Master's degree in Electrical Robotics and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. 
My main area of research is computational origami, and I have interests in pretty much everything in the STEM and Art fields. 
I work on a lot of projects that I will update this page with.

<!-- ### Why Github Pages?

I can work on and build this entire website in Jupyter Lab (my preferred IDE/code studio), so it works best for me.

### Where should I get updates from you and contact you?

I am most active on twitter, and I accept DMs. For non-collaborative business offers, please email me.

### Where can I support your work?

Right now I'm using ko-fi for commisions and exclusive content.
