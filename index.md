## Welcome to Foldster's Projects

This is where I will be hosting all of my content for now.

### Who I am

I am currently a graduate student studying robotics. I have interests in pretty much everything in the STEM and Art fields. I am also a content creator, but pretty bad at being a content shower, which is what most people care about, which is why I'm starting Foldster's Projects, my online personality.
