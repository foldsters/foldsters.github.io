# Fractal Flames

![Cool Fern](/Cool Fern.png)

Fractal flames are images produced by placing points according to rules depending on randomness or the location of the previous points, known as a chaos game. Then the points can be further modified by functions that modify the whole grid of points. You can find some of the ones I've done [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1-3bBA0azBAzL2a3q6sER0sO8IRdL3Q2Z).
