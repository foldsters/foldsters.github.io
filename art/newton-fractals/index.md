# Newton Fractals

Newton fractals are generated by applying Newton's method of finding roots to a complex function. 
The plot usually colored by how many iterations were taken to converge to some value.

Here are some of my favorites:

## Pen Plotting

I decided to see how some of these would turn out when plotted by a Cricut CNC machine.
