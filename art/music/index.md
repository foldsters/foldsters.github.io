# Music

Here's a collection of songs that I wrote and made myself. I usually make all my music using the free Caustic3 mobile or desktop app.

## Album-a-Day 1: Vising Day

An album following the [Crap Art](http://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/) rules, although I did complete it in 12 hours and went to bed. You can temporarily find this album [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1-0nmUNu3FQplntFUq3NwzZOSX-eFPSKF).
