# Spacewar! Chaos Cascade

This game was made for Pirate Software's 2020 Game Jam.

The game is based off of SPACEWAR! (1962). 
My goal was to keep the physics and gameplay mostly the same; however, I made it a 1P game,
and added an interesting bullet mechanic, sounds, and particle effects.

I mostly took on this project as a way of motivating myself to learn javascript, html, and how to make a physics-driven game. 
I went in with very low expectations, but this is probably one of the coolest things I've made.
Some of the things I've learned will probably change my programming toolkit and workflow forever.

You may have to resize the browser window for the manual and game to fit the screen properly.
