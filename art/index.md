# Art

I create art to explore ideas I find particularly interesting or beautiful, and seeing how much can be generated with it, so I can make art that I want to experience and share it with the people that like art for the same reasons I do.

These ideas tend to be some combination of clever ideas and solutions from the maths and sciences, and what ideas I was exposed to throughout my younger years.
