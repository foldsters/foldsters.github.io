# Music

Here's a collection of songs that I wrote and made myself. I usually make all my music using the free Caustic3 mobile or desktop app.

## Album A Day 1: Vising Day

An album following the Crap Art rules, although I did complete it in 12 hours and went to bed.
Just completed, You can temporarily find this album [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=10ftf_XbjfNCvkOZpxQ2-mJkcVl7q3rEy).
